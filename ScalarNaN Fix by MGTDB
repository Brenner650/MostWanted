Quote: "I wrote a fix for Most Wanted if a player sets a bounty with no tabs

this is what happens in database/bounties/bounty column
["N/A",scalar NaN,"Brian","7656119**********"]

Then it breaks server            
create an SQL procedure:-

update bounties 
set bounty = "[]"
where bounty LIKE '%NaN%';
END

run that every few mins or at each restart"
